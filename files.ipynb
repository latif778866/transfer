    "The file should exist in the same directory as the python program file else, full address of the file should be written on place of filename. Note: The r is placed before filename to prevent the characters in filename string to be treated as special character. For example, if there is \\temp in the file address, then \\t is treated as the tab character and error is raised of invalid address. The r makes the string raw, that is, it tells that the string is without any special characters. The r can be ignored if the file is in same directory and address is not being placed. "
